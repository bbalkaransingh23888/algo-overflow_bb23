### ARRAYS: EASY - TWO SUM ###

Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers
that add up to a given target.

ex: input => [1,3,7,9,2], t = 11; output => [3,4]
9+2=11 -> 9 is index 3, 2 is index 4 -> [3,4]
(1 is index 0, 3 is index 1, 7 is index 2)

Step 1: Verify the constraints (think about edgecases) => 
    - negative numbers or are all numbers positive?
    - are there duplicate numbers in the array or are they all unique?
    - will there always be a solution to the question or is it possible
    there is no possible solution? (an empty array or a one number array
    always wrong) => what do we return if there is no solution?
    - can multiple pairs add up to the given target value? 

Step 2: Write out test cases => 
    - Best case: input => [1,3,7,9,2], t = 11; output => [3,4] 
    - No solution: input => [1,3,7,9,2], t = 25; output => null
    - Empty array: input => [], t=1; output => null
    - One number array: input => [5], t=5; output => null (looking for a pair of numbers)
    - Low hanging fruit: input => [1,6], t=7; output => [0,1]

Step 3: Figure out a solution without code (pseudocode) =>
    - input => [1,3,7,9,2], t = 11
    - Try every pair of numbers => 1 + every other num in array, 3 + remainder, etc.
    until we find a pair that adds up to the target or go through every number without 
    finding a solution
    - Two pointer technique -> initialize 2 pointers and move them based on specified logic. 
        ex: p1 points to a specific number to test with other values, p2 represents
        the value p1 is being tested with at that time
    - number to find = target - nums[p1]
        ex: 11 - 1 = 10 = p2 -> after finding this value, compare it to each array 
        element. If the solution is found, p2 stops there. Otherwise, move p2. If p2 goes
        the entire array, p1 is moved over to the next array element and p2 is reset.
        nums = [1,3,7,9,2], t = 11; p2 = t - p1
            i)  p2 = 11 - 1 = 10 -> no possible answer
            ii) p2 = 11 - 3 = 8 -> no possible answer
            iii)p2 = 11 - 7 = 4 -> no possible answer 
            iv) p2 = 11 - 9 = 2 -> solution; 9 -> index 3, 2 -> index 4
